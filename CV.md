## About Myself:

For six years I have been working as a communication electromechanic at the railway. A few months ago I got interested in web development using technologies such as HTML, Css and Java Script.

I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth,
besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.

I hope my ability to learn and acquire new skills will help me become an experienced Frontend Developer.
